Before diving into Express.js, itâ€™s essential to familiarize yourself with these key Node.js concepts:

1. Modules & NPM:

Learn how to use require or import to include modules.

Understand how to install and manage packages with npm or yarn.



2. File System Operations:

Know how to read, write, and manipulate files using fs module.

Familiarize yourself with asynchronous operations and callbacks.



3. Asynchronous Programming:

Understand callbacks, promises, and async/await to manage asynchronous behavior effectively.



4. HTTP Module:

Learn how to create a basic HTTP server with http.createServer().

Understand handling requests and responses without any framework.



5. Event-Driven Architecture:

Get comfortable with Node's event system (EventEmitter) and streams.



6. Middleware Concept:

Learn the basics of middleware (functions that process requests and responses), which will make Express easier to grasp.




These fundamentals will help you transition smoothly to Express.js, where you'll use many of these concepts, especially for creating routes, handling requests, and managing middleware.
